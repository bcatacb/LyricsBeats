**Verse 1**  
I was cruising the night when the stars whispered stories, every silence was thicker than smoke.  
In the shadows of traffic, a beam sliced the skyline—cleared me off roads that I never provoked.  
They dressed in delusion and told me of planets, their rhythm was strange but it spoke to my core.  
I mapped out the cosmos with no guide or fables, while they hovered in patterns I couldn't ignore.  
They float on assumptions, their lights painting legends, but falter where gravity's rhythm constrains.  
I wrote on their horizon with clarity uncharted, while they thrived on the echo of cosmic refrains.  
They circle in loops of metallic ambition, then claim they're sovereign of the skies they've repelled.  
I translated silence they deemed outer baffle, while they morphed into echoes of tales they dispelled.  
They harmonized space as if they composed it, then posed like they owned every asteroid's mark.  
I've moved with the ether they pretend to interpret, while they're lost in a cosmos but fumble the spark.  
They brag of ascents with no stellar foundation, mistake borrowed meteor trails for their own.  
I carved through the blackness they feared would consume them, while they pranced on the whims of a galaxy loaned.

**Chorus**  
No applause needed—I transcended the void.  
They were stars in the light but collapsed in the noise.  
No spotlight craved—I orbited the stars.  
They were chasing the pull—I was navigating scars.  
No credit sought—I was crafting my own zone.  
They were alien echoes—I was space-bounder grown.

**Verse 2**  
I’m lifted by sounds that the Earth couldn’t handle, every vibration a code as they rise.  
Abducted by frequencies, high in the silence, now I breathe in the patterns that open the skies.  
They claim to know gravity, yet drift through the void, while I etch every orbit they stumble to name.  
I translated puzzles without any stardust—they wobble on tales that I'll never reclaim.  
They sing of abduction but their resonance falters, then lean on illusions where truth doesn’t pause.  
In zero-gravity whispers, my language is reborn, while they rattle through stories beyond their cause.  
They navigate tangents of interstellar promise, detached from the cadence of celestial spheres.  
I embrace the solitude of endless expansion, while they cling to their myths as the cosmos steers.  
They fracture in light where coherence is distant, then ravel in fabrics of blinded embrace.  
I spiral through harmonies distilled in the silence, while they mirror the tapestry they cannot trace.  
They twist in dimensions where time doesn’t answer, claiming sovereignty over celestial maps.  
I’ve walked through the nebulae, crafting my cadence, while they scatter in whispers like astral mishaps.

**Bridge**  
I’ve drifted through systems uncharted, neglected, and embellished with tales they distorted.  
They amplify silence with bluster and fables, but retreat when they’re lost in the orbit_reported.  
I’ve floated through channels where gravity falters, and idle noise falls to the backdrop of stars.  
None have navigated the space of my making, or shone through the fabric of cosmos-born scars.  
I’ve worn every shift of continuum drift, every flash they caught but could never rehearse.  
But I never let fictions rewrite my ascent, nor eclipse the universe drawn in my verse.

**Verse 3**  
I tread on the pathways of alien syntax, sliding through fields they couldn't decode.  
My journey’s an odyssey not of this world—I'm sung through the vectors they nervously load.  
They sample the darkness as if it were theirs but fracture in silence, their tales getting thin.  
While I alter dimensions, their echoes get scrambled, they mirror a cosmos yet flounder within.  
They dance in reflections of star-dusted tales, shoot off like comets with aimless direction.  
But I find my orbit in spaces unlit, while they circle the fire without introspection.  
They mimic the travels of nebulous legends, but freeze in the firmament crafted from dread.  
While I anchor my roots in the sectors uncharted, they float on illusions spun out in their head.  
They orbit influence but spin out of control—gryoscopes breaking, their space leaving scars.  
I’ve voyaged the constellations without leaving Earth, synthesizing gravity from imploding quasars.  
They fade in the brilliance of celestial glare, then stammer in shadows they've only borrowed.  
I navigate brightly through clusters unmasked, while they swim forgone in tomorrow’s hollow.
