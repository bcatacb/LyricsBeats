(Verse 1)  
Yeah, I’m stackin’ racks, got the cheddar like a dairy, (uh)  
In the fast lane, driftin' clean, ain't no fairy, (woo)  
Countin' up blessings like I'm on my rosary,  
In a foreign whip, cruisin', feelin' so carefree, (skrrt skrrt)  

Talkin' big moves on my iPhone, FaceTime,  
Motivate the streets, every lyric in its prime, (yup)  
Wakin' up the hustle, got a vision with a shine,  
From the bottom to the penthouse, now the skyline's mine, (ay)

(Hook)  
Drippin' with the sauce, yeah, I’m always in the zone, (in the zone)  
Paper chasin’ daily, stack it up some more, (stack it up)  
Dreams on reality, I’m sittin’ on my throne, (yeah)  
Success in the air, yeah, you know I’m in the zone, (woo)  

(Verse 2)  
Cash flow on repeat, got the world on my wrist,  
Turnin' all the struggles into platinum hits, (yeah)  
Elevate the mindset, that’s the ultimate gist,  
With my crew, keep it tight, never switch, no assist, (uh)  

Champagne showers, every night a new blitz,  
Goals on the board, can’t afford to miss, (nah)  
Manifest the dreams, from the vision to the bliss,  
Every day we hustlin’, city bright like a glitz, (ay)  

(Hook)  
Drippin' with the sauce, yeah, I’m always in the zone, (in the zone)  
Paper chasin’ daily, stack it up some more, (stack it up)  
Dreams on reality, I’m sittin’ on my throne, (yeah)  
Success in the air, yeah, you know I’m in the zone, (woo)
