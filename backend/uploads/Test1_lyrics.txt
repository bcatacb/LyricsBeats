### Verse 1
I’m counting the hours that vanish unyielded in rooms where the silence devours the call.  
While they pace in the echoes and grasp for the pardon, I walk through the void where the truthful ones fall.  
They lean on the noise just to justify motion, then falter when solitude tests their resolve.  
I crafted from seconds that whispered to linger, while they masked every second that couldn't evolve.  
They echo the might they have never encountered, claiming ascent they refused to pursue.  
But I wrote from the depth of disquiet and rigor, where silence engraved every truth they withdrew.  
They conjure from scraps they refuse to acknowledge, then pose like it’s etched from a personal plight.  
I script from the grit that refused to ignore me, while they mirror the glow that conceals the real fight.  
They map out their climb on the wings of delusion, while dodging the mire that came with the rise.  
I learned every pulse from the curves of the silence, while they stagger on echoes that parrot their lies.  

### Chorus
Too many days where the silence was holding, too many nights where the vision was clear.  
I forged in the dark with no crowded distractions, I walked through the weight with the braver veneer.  
Too many faces that wanted the limelight, too many voices that drowned in the fame.  
I wrote in the spaces between every flicker, I carved out the fortune they never could claim.  

### Verse 2
They're naming the cost but they've never invested, just tap on the surface and mimic the grind.  
While I harness the moments abandoned by structure, they're lost in the fiction their echoes designed.  
They photocopy struggle and paint it as wisdom, then pivot for praise when the lens is on them.  
I drafted from shadows they covered with pretense, while they mimic the heights they were told to condemn.  
They twist every line to fit inside the riddle, then claim that the puzzle was one they resolved.  
I walk with the truth of every missed opportunity, rewriting the script from the grime absolved.  
They're posing for legacy behind empty phrases, but retract at the glance of the scrutiny’s edge.  
I constructed from voids they dismissed as barren, while erecting the frame that aligns with my pledge.  
They're lost in the shimmer of borrowed acclaim, grappling for hist'ry they never could own.  
I resurrect from the silence they vacate, ascending with weight through the paths I’ve outgrown.  

### Bridge
Days drift like clouds where the silent ones linger, holding the scars they refuse to erase.  
I’ve charted the cost of standing in stillness, engraving the fear on the relics they chase.  
In rooms where the silence speaks louder than ego, I've witnessed the falsehoods they failed to expel.  
They lean on the crutch of borrowed ambition, while I sculpt from the silence they feared to compel.  

### Verse 3
I’m tuning the cadence of time unacknowledged, advancing through minutes they shunned and besmirched.  
While they tremor on fragments of echoed assumption, I'm birthing the legend on layers unearthed.  
They anchor their tales on the mirage of victories, yet falter when shadows demand recompense.  
I command from the enclave of unspoken virtue, riding through silence with mastery immense.  
They vaunt hollow crowns in the court of perception, then shrink in the silence that builds the demise.  
I script in the stillness of muted ambitions, where legends unravel and frailty lies.  
They squander each second in circuits of folly, entrenched by the fiction that never sustains.  
I script from the ruins of unclaimed potential, while they forge their narratives intertwined with chains.  
Their walls may embolden the flight of illusions, but crumble when history inspects their grace.  
I rise from the deep where the true hearts convene, crafting the legacy they dare not esp'ce.
