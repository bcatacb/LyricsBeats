**Verse 1**  
Built my empire slow with mortar and sweat, no shortcuts to fame, no playing pretend.  
I walked through the ruins where echoes were loudest, climbed out of failures they wouldn't commend.  
While they count on the crowd to inflate their illusion, I count every step till the summit’s complete.  
Where they ride on the waves of the pre-written praises, I’m rooted in truth where my ambitions meet.  
They pivot to fame where the shine feels rewarding, but bail when the silence demands a clear mind.  
I dwell in the quiet, decode every echo, while they shift like shadows, consumed by the blind.  
They rhyme with the fiction they push like religion, then falter when history calls for more proof.  
I build from the ashes they brushed as forgotten, turning whispers of doubt to the walls of my truth.  
They followed the blueprint they never designed, then panic when fractures creep up in the tone.  
I forged through the halls that they treated as vacant, drawing maps of conviction, owning my zone.  
While they borrow every tune, claiming hearts they delude, I articulate steps with the weight of my pen.  
I channel through gaps they gloss over in daylight, constructing a path that’s beyond their ken.  
Where they falter in light, losing all in the dusk, I refine every bar till the clarity stuns.  
I trace through the layers in patterns they skip, while their echoes dissolve in the light of my runs.  
They climb for the view but shun the ascent, where heights are imagined, I ground in the climb.  
Enhanced from the moments they count out as losses, I echo resilience through power and time.

**Chorus**  
No frills needed—I thrive in the blend.  
They marvel at apex but their arcs always bend.  
No stage lights craved—I maneuver in shade.  
They glorify noise—I craft from the fade.  
No praise expected—it's all in my strides.  
While they float on the surface—I anchor my tides.

**Verse 2**  
They lift with the wind that's fleeting at best, then flounder when stillness uncovers what's real.  
I brace in the hum of the past and the present, shaping paths from their voids, steering the wheel.  
They strut in the garb of the accolades loaned, claiming realms in illusion that soon they'll forsake.  
I etch every scar in the ledger of wisdom, forging kingdoms where hollow pretense would break.  
They boast of the archives they never compiled, then scramble when weight demands they secure.  
I carve through the quiet, reborn in the weight, drawing arcs where their echoes dissolve and obscure.  
Where they rest on the laurels of superficial assent, I dig deeper, crafting the void into song.  
They hinge on the applause that melts in the silence, while I shape definition from echoes prolonged.  
They mimic the rhythm that falters mid-beat, then protest when silence dictates their retreat.  
I trace every pulse, learning depth from restraint, turning whispers of truth into beats for my feat.  
While they parrot the roles they inherit by chance, I construct every chord from intention and heart.  
They falter in shadows, blind to the core, while I serve as the voice in the echo of art.  
They drift through the corridors of transitory fame, where noise is the marker but fades unaligned.  
I navigate notes that they claim to inspire, grounding riffs in the climb that my purpose designed.

**Bridge**  
In every fold of silence, I find strength unspoken, in rooms they abandon I find my command.  
No need for empires built on fleeting acclaim, I crave the solitude where my echoes expand.  
Through open corridors of truth, I tread, etching lines in the void they strive to withstand.  
In legacies built upon shadows they pass, I compose the resilience no hollow can brand.
