(Verse 1)  
Ayy, woke up in the penthouse, views like a king's crown, /  
Countin' all these bands up, ain't no way we slowin' down, /  
Hustle be relentless, yeah, I came up from the ground, /  
No more ramen noodles, now it's lobster when I chow, /

(Pre-Chorus)  
Investin' in the future, vision lookin' 4K, /  
Livin' out my dreams, man, I ain't here to play, /  
Stackin' up this paper, countin' racks every day, /  
Feelin' like a boss, you know I own the whole bay, /

(Chorus)  
Success in my veins, you see the hustle never stop, /  
Money keep on risin', yeah, we goin' to the top, /  
Motivation in my soul, got the game on lock, /  
Livin' like a legend, see my story, it's my prop, /

(Verse 2)  
Drippin' in designer, man, I'm fresher than a mint, /  
Got these cuban links, my wrist is icy, watch it glint, /  
Manifested dreams, now they watchin', all intent, /  
Grindin' every day, boy, I'm never on the bench, /

(Bridge)  
Shout out to the squad, yeah, we came up from the trenches, /  
Turned our losses into lessons, now we ridin' in the Benzes, /  
Vision in the tunnel, now I'm seein' all the lenses, /  
Buildin' up these empires, breakin' down defenses, /

(Chorus)  
Success in my veins, you see the hustle never stop, /  
Money keep on risin', yeah, we goin' to the top, /  
Motivation in my soul, got the game on lock, /  
Livin' like a legend, see my story, it's my prop, / 

(Outro)  
From the dirt to the mansion, put in work, this ain't luck, /  
Life is cinematic, every scene I construct, /  
Feelin' so electric, like the rims on my truck, /  
Motivation's my addiction, never givin' up, /
