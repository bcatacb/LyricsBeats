Verse 1  
In shadow’s domain where the whispers pulled focus, I drafted my message with pen on the edge.  
They grasp at applause like it’s proof of their presence, but I crafted resolve in the cracks they misjudge.  
They script out the climb like a blueprint for daydreams, then crumble and shift when the challenges soar.  
I traversed every step without craving the witness, while they lavish in echoes and exit the door.  
They clutch to the noise when the silence invades them, then boast of their place when the curtain reclaims.  
I etched from the void without cadence beside me, while they trace every pulse but forget the frames.  
They stagger through thoughts where the truth never settles, then post like they braved every crest and the stray.  
I honed from the quiet they mocked as indifference, while they limelight in borrowed and dance in delay.  
They hum to the groove they never composed, then pose like they scripted each bar from the core.  
I weave from the substance they mimic for margin, while they knock on the gates that were never secure.  
They lean on the frail when the shadows are blinding, then pivot for show when the crowd re-aligns.  
I strip back the clutter with essence and poise, while they mirror the arc but dissolve in decline.  
They flicker in brightness but fumble in dark, then scramble for roots that don’t tether their map.  
I fine-tune the urgency in rhythms they mimic, while they chase moving lines that fade into gap.  
They mimic ascent but skip structural codes, then claim they engraved every peak with esteem.  
I surged from the hush they dismissed as the void, now they tremor in rooms they built to mislead.

Chorus  
No ovation required—I was forged from the hush.  
They were noise in the bloom but they cracked under rush.  
No spotlight requested—I ascend the incline.  
They pursued fleeting fame—I sculpted the rhyme.  
No credit desired—I was zoned in the grind.  
They built for the glance—I designed from the bind.
