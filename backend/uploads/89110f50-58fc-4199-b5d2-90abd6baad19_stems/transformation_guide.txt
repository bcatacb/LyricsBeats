# Audio-to-MIDI Transformation Results

## Original Composition Breakdown

This transformation has converted your uploaded instrumental into:

### MIDI Files (Ready for DAW Import):
- bass.mid
- kick.mid
- melody.mid
- percussion.mid
- harmony.mid

### MusicXML Files (Musical Notation):
- bass.musicxml
- kick.musicxml
- melody.musicxml
- percussion.musicxml
- harmony.musicxml
- full_arrangement.musicxml

### How to Use These Files:

1. **MIDI Files (.mid)**:
   - Import into any DAW (Logic Pro, Ableton, FL Studio, etc.)
   - Change instruments on each track to create completely new sounds
   - Modify tempo, key, and arrangements
   - Layer with your own recordings

2. **MusicXML Files (.musicxml)**:
   - Open in notation software (Sibelius, Finale, MuseScore)
   - Edit the musical notation directly
   - Print as sheet music
   - Share with musicians for live performance

### Legal Benefits:
- **Original Composition**: These MIDI files represent the musical structure, not the original audio
- **Transformative Use**: You can create entirely new recordings using these arrangements
- **Copyright Ready**: Your new compositions using these files are original works
- **Commercial Use**: Safe for commercial release and copyright registration

### Recommended Workflow:
1. Import MIDI files into your DAW
2. Assign different instruments to each track
3. Adjust velocities, timing, and expression
4. Add your own elements (vocals, additional instruments)
5. Mix and master as your original composition
