**(Intro)**
Yeah, yeah, ah, let's get it, uh  
Feelin’ hungry for the top, yuh  

**(Verse 1)**
Skrrt off in the Lambo, eatin’ up the road,  
Stackin’ chips like Pringles, you know how it goes,  
Got the ice on my wrist, keep my neck stayin’ froze, (uh)  
Ain’t been broke in a minute, pockets overflowed.  

Hungry for the hustle, I ain't talkin' ‘bout snacks,  
Investin’ in my grind, made a king out of rags,  
Vision 20/20, cash flow never lag,  
Seen the bottom, now we rise, got my name on the flag.  

**(Hook)**
Money on my mind, I’m eatin’ up the game,  
Success on my plate, gotta feed that flame,  
Hungry for the top, y’all know my name,  
Livin’ lavish, now we ain't the same.  

**(Verse 2)**
Swag on a hundred, haters look astonished,  
Talkin’ big numbers, my math ain't gon’ be modest.  
From the block to the boardroom, always kept it honest,  
Runnin’ up the commas, got my family astonished.  

Marble floors in the crib, gold links 'round my neck, (uh)  
‘Member when I dreamt it, now I cash every check, (yeah)  
Never goin’ hungry, always after that flex,  
Drippin’ sauce, in that Gucci, movin’ on to the next.  

**(Hook)**
Money on my mind, I’m eatin’ up the game,  
Success on my plate, gotta feed that flame,  
Hungry for the top, y’all know my name,  
Livin’ lavish, now we ain't the same.  

**(Outro)**
Yeah, uh, y'all know we out here,  
Stay hungry, never full, yuh,  
Top-tier lifestyle, that’s how we roll,  
Let's get it, woo!
